### About myself  
I studied and worked in the energy sector, but I have always been attracted to the topic of programming. It seemed to me that it was something superhuman, to create websites and applications out of nothing.  

But still I decided to try my hand. I started doing it myself by trial and error. Quite by accident I found RS School courses and began to study with great pleasure. Every time I encountered difficulties, I wanted to understand the topic as quickly as possible and complete the task.  

Now my goal is to become a great developer, so I spend all my free time learning.
