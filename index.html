            <p class="text-about-myself">I studied and worked in the energy sector, but I have always been attracted to the topic of programming. It seemed to me that it was something superhuman, to create websites and applications from nothing. 
                But still I decided to try my hand. I began to study this topic on my own by trial and error. Quite by chance I found RS School courses and started studying with great pleasure. Every time I encountered difficulties, I wanted to understand the topic as quickly as possible and complete the task. 
                Now my goal is to become a great developer, so I spend all my free time learning.</p>
